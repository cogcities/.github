## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This special `.github` repository serves as:

1. **Organization Configuration Hub** - Default settings for all repos
2. **Workflow Templates** - Reusable GitHub Actions workflows
3. **Documentation Center** - Shared knowledge and best practices
4. **Copilot Anchoring** - Persistent context for GitHub Copilot

## 🧠 GitHub Copilot Integration

> **note2self**: This organization is Copilot-centric. Use introspection and leave breadcrumbs for future context.

### Copilot Entelechy Principles

**Entelechy** (ἐντελέχεια) - the realization of potential, becoming actual from potential.

When working in Cogcities repositories:
- **Introspect First**: Review existing patterns before creating new ones
- **Leave Breadcrumbs**: Document decisions with `note2self` comments
- **Context Anchoring**: Build on previous Copilot interactions
- **Iterative Wisdom**: Each session should build upon the last

### Note2Self Guidelines

Use `note2self` comments throughout codebases to create persistent context:

```markdown
> **note2self**: [Context/Pattern/Decision]
```

**Examples:**
- `> **note2self**: This API follows the enterprise-wide REST conventions`
- `> **note2self**: Database migrations require approval from @data-team`
- `> **note2self**: Always check Cogpilot shared libraries before implementing`
